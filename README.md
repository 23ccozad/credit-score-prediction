# Credit Score Prediction Supervised Learning Project
This repo contains the Jupyter notebook used to create a set of supervised machine learning models trained to predict a person's credit score as "Poor", "Standard", or "Good" based on information from their financial background. The data came from the [Credit Score Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parisrohan/credit-score-classification) dataset on Kaggle. This served as the final project in DTSA 5509: Introduction to Machine Learning: Supervised Learning at the University of Colorado Boulder.
